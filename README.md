# mixer-chat-css
Custom CSS for Mixer chat embed to allow transparency and removal of junk that would otherwise not be useful on your overlay  
To start working with this custom CSS, create a Browser source in your transcoding software (OBS, Xplit), then head over to your Mixer stream page and click the **3dot** symbol in your chat window.  
You should then see a pop-up with 4 different options. You need the "floating" chat option. Once you clicked it, you will get a browser window pop-up with your chat embed link. Copy the link and paste it into your transcoding sotfware's Browser source URL field.  
After that copy the code from [the CSS file from this repository](https://github.com/KatouMegumi-osu/mixer-chat-css/blob/master/chat.css) and copy paste the code into your CSS field box in the browser source. After that you can save changes.
